# MindPlay Islands Project 🌴

MindPlay Islands is a gamified educational platform designed to teach Python programming to children in a fun and engaging way. This project was developed as part of my B.A. thesis in **Instructional Technologies** at **HIT Holon Institute of Technology**.

The platform features an interactive learning environment where kids complete Python exercises through various levels, gaining points and unlocking characters. It promotes independent learning, enhances problem-solving skills, and fosters computational thinking, all while keeping learners motivated with immediate feedback and gamified progression.
